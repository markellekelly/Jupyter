Chapter 2.1: Data Providers
===========================



#### How/where did you collect data?
The data for most of the graphs and calculations was pulled from John Hopkins as downloadable csv files. Population counts per county were downloaded off of (SOURCE). LA and NYC had data available at their respective county health websites. These sites provided links to their data frames or downloadable csv files. 
#### What are some challenges when collecting each data set?
When looking at specific counties, I made efforts to search county websites for their own local data files. Many of the county websites I parsed stored their data in immutable formats, like pdf documents. Or worse, they create semi-interactive graphs of their data, with no link or ability to look at the raw data they used to create such models. Rather than quickly downloading a csv file containing case or death counts over the course of months, the only option to manipulate the data required manually entering each cell into my own csv file. 
#### How do counties compare in their data sources?
LAâ€™s department of health provided its own data set of confirmed cases, deaths, and tests administered. There was a button that provided an automatic link to their csv file, however, the link would change daily. So, to update LA's data I had to go back to their health department's website and obtain a new link. Further more, the COVID 19 data page of the site was often down and unreachable. New York city also had an extensive data archive on github that provided Covid data across multiple demographic categories. Lane OR, Cook IL, Maricopa AZ, and Miami-Dade FL stored their COVID 19 data in pdfs or graphs that were updated daily. This made downloading their county data extremely difficult and time consuming, in some cases requiring manual entry for every data point.
