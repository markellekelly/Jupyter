INTRO
============================

Background:  
My experience analyzing data, before beginning my internship at Jupyter, was limited. In the wake of a global pandemic like COVID 19, there was a surplus of data, statistics, and research that arose. I only came into contact with graphs and statistics that were available on the media and news sources I frequented. Without knowing any better, I often accepted whichever analyses were spun, as objective facts. However, there came a point when I had been bombarded with so much data, so many graphs, so many narratives, that COVID 19 became too noisy to have a clear picture of what was going on. I was compelled to ignore the stream of information all together. And I don’t think that I was alone in feeling this way. This project gave me the tools to look at the available data myself, manipulate it according to how I saw fit, and make predictions and estimates based on my own research. 

Questions I sought to answer:    
1.) What are the true number of infections in the USA?  
2.) Survey most populated counties: what are the number of infections over days for  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. LA   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Cook  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. NYC  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Maricopa  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Miami-Dade  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. My home county (Lane County)   
3.) Where are “we” flattening the curve?
