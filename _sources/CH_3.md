Chapter 3: Results
=======================

This chapter covers the entirety of my exploration into COVID 19 data over the course of this internship. The first section looks at the US as a whole and displays a stark comparison between reported cases and the possible true number of infections. The next section dives into individual counties, starting with Los Angeles California, and derives a new metric to estimate infections. Section 3 covers Maricopa Arizona. In the 4th section, the metric derived in sections 1 and 2 is applied to other counties, and cross validated for accuracy. Section 5 examines how the virus has spread and changed over time, using fundamental tools of calculus. The final section attempts to answer the question, How might the virus spread in the future?
